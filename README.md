# Work Flow

- I would say this project was easier for me than the previous coding quiz. Besides the moment.js implementation, everything here I got some exposure with in the previous JS we did. It wasn't learning it for the first time, it was taking what we knew and doing more. The concept of parents, siblings, and children we cool to explore so I could properly use the this property. The different functions I would say are more complex than previous work but it was much shorter. Jquery did help a lot in shortening the actual code.
